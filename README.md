# Genetic Analysis Tool
 
This program is an open-source genetic analysis tool that can identify a few genetic mutations associated with essential thrombocytosis (a rare blood disorder that causes the bone marrow to produce excess platelets resulting in excess clotting. ET is also known as primary thrombocythemia.)

It leverages pandas to import genome files, read, and analyze them.
